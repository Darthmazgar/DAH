#Different convergence methods#
Standard on/off

Hysteretic loop, different for heating than for cooling.

What ever this is, https://docs.sympy.org/0.7.1/modules/mpmath/functions/hypergeometric.html

scipy optimize. minimize?

Use these then compare run times to cool from a temp to another. (relative to room tmp)

#Cooling efficency#

Compare the energy used from the voltage and time to find the exp heat capacity and compare this to a known heat capacity of water.
